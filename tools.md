These are guides and tools I recommend for your privacy and safety. Mostly for
my own bookkeeping. I find it useful to share these. Use at own risk, these
are no guarantees for a full bulletproof system. But it's best to have some
protection than none, you'll be surprised on your exposed vulnerabilites
without these tools.
