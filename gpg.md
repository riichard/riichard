As a modern etiquette to our mutual privacy, it's respectful to treat our
information with delicacy. Just as much some people call showing up clean and
prepared 'respectful' is this an etiquette guideline for modern communications.

## Texting

### Avoid
Please avoid using services like SMS/Text, Whatsapp, Messenger, Telegram and Snapchat.
Claiming these to be private is naive. They do not comply as ["free
software"](https://www.fsf.org/about/) and do not support e2e encryption by
default, nor offer full transparency in it's e2e protocol.

### Please do use for messaging

- [Signal Messenger](https://www.signal.org/) for chats, Also [recommended by
    Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152) and is fully transparent in [it's source
    code](https://github.com/whispersystems). You can use my
    regular phone number.
- [Wickr](https://www.wickr.com/) for one-time messages. Not "free". [Only it's encryption
    library is public](https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c). Username: `riichard`

Avoidance of proper tooling indicates me you're not initiated on privacy
issues as most people are. I'm open to tell you more on how to set these things
up, as I'll also try to write about it on my website.

## Email

Contact me on `stdin` @ `riichard.com`. It's servers run by Protonmail and is
secure enough for most purposes, for extra layers of encryption I recommend
using my pgp keys which aren't shared with ProtonMail.

It's not required to install protonmail to contact me, but it's free and I
highly recommend it over Google Mail/Gmail if you don't want others to read
your inbox (read: [Why ProtonMail is more secure than Gmail](https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-vs-gmail-security/).

Protonmail is encrypted, only accessible by me, and it's data is stored in
heavily guarded [Swiss Bunkers under 1000 meter of granite rock](https://protonmail.com/security-details) who can survive nuclear attacks and protected by [Swiss Privacy laws](https://protonmail.com/blog/switzerland/).

## Pictures

If you want to be respectful to me and others consider these rules normal:

1. Please ask me first if you can take a picture of me.
2. If you've taken a picture, then consent again whether you can share it with others.
3. If I told you it's ok to share it with others, check first if you can tag me in it. Facebook's search still shows pictures even if I've denied consent.
4. Don't consider that if I've permitted you for one picture, you can keep on taking pictures or sharing other pictures. Neither in the same series of the event.

## GnuPG/OpenPGP keys

You can use these keys and fingerprints to verify my authenticity and securely
send me encrypted files/texts. These keys are of course no guarantee to be
really me. So for extra guarantee of verification ask me in person, and check
my key on the MIT Keyserver for updates and revokes > [Key history on the MIT Keyserver](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=riichard.com&op=index)

In any case of doubt about my private key will the key be revoked on that server by either me or one
of my trusted contacts.
