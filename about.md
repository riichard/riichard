title: About Richard Kraaijenhagen
---

I'm a full stack developer. I started my first company when I was 16 and sold
my shares in a successful exit at 22. 

Starting Owlin from the ground up, I've helped Owlin grow to a successful
business providing big data analytics to some of the biggest corporations in
Europe including KPMG, Deloitte, ING and many other high-profile equity trading
firms.  
Owlin received high honoured awards from Accenture and Pioneers. 

I left Owlin in 2015 to focus on gaining broader experiences. I still remain
actively involved as an advisor to the company. 

Currently I'm working open source projects and am orienting myself for my next
endeavour.  I'm technomading around the world, currently staying in Tokyo.
I volunteer at schools giving after school programming classes to inspire them
to the field at a young age. 

Best way to contact me is by using stdin@riichard.com.

More about me, I enjoy coffee brewing, traveling, tuning my custom keyboard layout, 
like running, quantifying myself, tinkering with hardware & video editing.
