As a modern etiquette to our mutual privacy, it's respectful to treat our
information with care. 

## Texting

### Avoid
Please avoid using services like SMS/Text, Whatsapp, Messenger, Telegram and
Snapchat with me.  They do not guarantee privacy and can;t comply as ["free
software"](https://www.fsf.org/about/), nor do they support e2e encryption by
default, or offer full transparency in it's encryption protocol.

### Please do use for texting

- [Signal Messenger](https://www.signal.org/) for chats, Also [recommended by Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152) and is fully transparent in [it's source
    code](https://github.com/whispersystems). You can use my
    regular phone number.
- [Wickr](https://www.wickr.com/) for one-time messages. Not "free". [Only it's encryption
    library is public](https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c). Username: `riichard`

## Why I'm no longer on Snapchat
Snapchat brutely goes against my human principles of sharing data. The app almost becomes unusable without sharing your location data. There's much spoken on how it's image recognition and facial recognition is shared with third parties, and how this humanitarian violation is publicly described in their terms of service. 
If you really want to send me your privates, send them to me on Signal and schedule the message to expire.  

## Email

Contact me on `stdin` @ `riichard.com`.  

Email is stored encrypted, in Swiss nuclear army bunkers, protected under Swiss privacy law. If you want to store email encrypted on your end as well, I recommend ProtonMail. It's free, and unlike with Google's Gmail where _you_ are the product (that's why it's free btw), you won't have others read your email, share it with advertisers, or third party apps leaking it out to the public. 

# GnuPG/OpenPGP keys

You can use these keys and fingerprints to verify my authenticity and securely
send me encrypted files/texts. These keys are of course no guarantee to be
really me. So for extra guarantee of verification ask me in person, and check
my key on the MIT Keyserver for updates and revokes > [Key history on the MIT Keyserver](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=riichard.com&op=index)

In any case of doubt about my private key will the key be revoked on that server by either me or one
of my trusted contacts.
