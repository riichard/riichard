AMSTERDAM - This year at The Next Web's annual hackathon, my partner and I
created a hack called Hashtagivist. Promoting hashtags for social justice on
Twitter.

# Hashtagivist

Hashtagivist stands for "Hashtag Activist" was inspired by the amazing work of
Suey Park, Mikki Kendall, and other proponents for social change and equality
on Twitter.

There are so many of us that believe in equality, and want to lobby for social
change, but either aren't that well-versed with Twitter, or have trouble
finding hashtag campaigns. For me, I'd always catch campaigns after-the-fact
via a blog post, and think to myself, "Gee, I wish I had seen that on Twitter
when it was happening. I would have definitely retweeted, or taken action in
some way."

With Hashtagivist, campaign leaders can submit their hashtags to the site
before they launch their campaign via Twitter. Then, they can track their
hashtag stats on Hashtagivist, and gain wider exposure for their campaign.

Users can search the site by topic (more topics to come!), and receive email
alerts as soon as a new hashtag campaign goes live in their areas of interest.

## Design

The technological nor visual aspect of the hack wasn't too interesting. But the
vision behind it, to have a simple platform where you would just find hashtags
to show what you stand for, brings out what the power of Twitter stands for:
Power to the people.
When enough people on twitter share their voices and start tweeting, we can
raise awareness to topics that usually don't get covered.

Hashtagivist concept was awarded by Twitter and got [covered by The Next Web].
