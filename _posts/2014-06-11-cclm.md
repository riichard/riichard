Did you ever wonder how Owlin is able to gather articles from a number of languages and sort them by subject? This is made possible in part by a [statistical language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) developed by Owlin in cooperation with scientists from Stanford University and Edinburgh University. 
The 5.6 terabyte model, which brings natural language processing to a new level, is now the subject of a [scientific article](http://statmt.org/ngrams/pages/poster.html) written by Owlin's Bas van Ooyen with co-developers Christian Buck of the University of Edinburgh and Kenneth Heafield of Stanford University and presented last week at the [Language Recources and Evaluation Conference](http://lrec2014.lrec-conf.org/en/) in Reykjavik Iceland.
