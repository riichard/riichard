This year at Owlin we connected our big data analytics to some of the
biggest corporations in Europe including [KPMG], [Deloitte], [ING] and many
other high-profile equity trading firms. Our team's hard work was then awarded
by the top awards in the business like the [Accenture] Innovation Awards and
the [Pioneers] festival. 

I'm incredibly proud to have not only programmed an excellent product that
works seamlessly, but also that Owlin has  received so much public recognition,
and has reached the state of a profitable startup. I'm beyond confident in the
future success of Owlin, as I'm leaving the company in the incredibly competent
hands of my co-founders.  <br>
After working on the core technology behind Owlin for more than 5 years, I have
seen Owlin grow from my own pet project as a mere teen, to a self-sustaining
company - serving the most in-depth, and fastest news analysis to the greatest
hedge funds, banks, and accountants in the world.<br>
When I was programming at the age of 14, I imagined a dream job that would
allow me the opportunity to build a profitable business for in-depth analysis
of big data. Now that I have reached my goal, I have decided to move on to
follow even greater dreams. I will now hone my skills in programming in other
industries to gain an even wider skill-set. Again, I'm only 22. Steve Jobs and
Larry Page weren't even started at this age. I've got a lot more to learn, and
accomplish.

At Owlin I headed the development of our product by spearheading Agile/Scrum
management for our team. I also set up real-time big data filtering pipelines
using a custom algorithm developed in-part by our Data Scientist and resident
Quantum physicist, Dr. Westra. I then visualized this data into a beautiful and
user-friendly interface using HTML5/CSS3 through websockets. I'm specifically
proud of Owlin's database that is expanding at a monthly speed of 25Terabytes.

As you can see, I seek out challenges, and make it my mission to solve them. As
a full-stack developer with an intense passion for learning and growth, Iâ€™m
ready to move on to the next adventure and continue to increase my strengths.
I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to sell most of my shares to
my co-founders. In the future, I will look into Angel Investing with my Future
Ventures foundation to help other startups to get started in the right
direction, and will stay involved with Owlin as a permanent advisor.  It's been
a wild ride from raising [VC funding], and getting covered by [major] [news]
 [websites], to passionately working day-to-day on some of the world's most
cutting-edge data analysis. 

We live in an incredibly exciting time of exponential innovation; especially in
the world of communication. From the rise of mobile and touch-screen
technology, to communication-enhancing apps like Twitter, and Whatsapp, we've
come a long way in a very short timeframe.  <br>
It's my personal mission to extend humankind's ability to communicate by
continually innovating upon the latest technologies. In my opinion, the ability
to communicate and share one's knowledge is truly a multiplier of success
towards a future world of increasing progress.<br>
With Owlin, my goal was to top Bloomberg by getting a 360 degree news view to
our clients [faster than any other service]. I'm still enraptured by the idea
of optimizing the transferral of knowledge, and communication's ability to
transform society for the better. Let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.
