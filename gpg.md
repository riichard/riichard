# GnuPG/OpenPGP keys

You can use these keys and fingerprints to verify my authenticity and securely
send me encrypted files/texts. These keys are of course no guarantee to be
really me. So for extra guarantee of verification ask me in person, and check
my key on the MIT Keyserver for updates and revokes > [Key history on the MIT Keyserver](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=riichard.com&op=index)

In any case of doubt about my private key will the key be revoked on that server by either me or one
of my trusted contacts.
