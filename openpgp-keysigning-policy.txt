I, the holder of the OpenPGP key 0x1BD95BD9E18474D1, hereby describes
the policy I apply when certifying other OpenPGP public keys.


Certification levels
====================

    As per RFC 4880 §5.2.1 [1], User IDs can be certified using four distinct
    levels, which are dubbed “generic” (level 0x10 in GnuPG manuals), “persona”
    (level 0x11), “casual” (level 0x12), and “positive” (level 0x13) [1].

    Here is how I appreciate and use these levels, specified by octet in the
    certification level when signing a key: 

      0x11: Persona certification of a User ID and Public-Key packet.
        If I have have not done any verification of the claim that the owner
        of this key is the User ID specified. I rarely sign keys under this
        level.

      0x12: Casual certification of a User ID and Public-Key packet. 
        I've done some casual verification of the claim of identity. I use this
        level if the user does not disclose it's full name in the Public-Key
        packet, but will sign it under 0x12 if it does contain a photo.

      0x13: Positive certification of a User ID and Public-Key packet.
        I've done substantial verification of the claim of identity.
        Including a check of government issued ID, and check of the
        fingerprint of the Public-Key packet.

        The user may choose conceal irrelevant Personal Identifiable
        Information (PII) or Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) from it's
        governemnt ID.  Such as the place of birth, date of birth, and social
        security number.  With the exception of expire date, photo, and
        fullname.


Signature distribution
======================

    As an additional method of verification, signatures are only sent encrypted
    by email to the email address specified by the Public-Key packet. The
    keyholder is responsible for decrypting the message in order to use, or
    upload the signature.


Trust signatures
================

    I don’t emit “trust signatures” (RFC 4880 $5.2.3.13).
